### SSL ciphers suite problem (solved)


This is not actually from his video. But, after successfully installing Burp Suite, I encountered browser HTTPS errors because the Burp proxy and the target website (yahoo.com) could not agree on a cipher suite. Here's some packet detail that I grabbed with Wireshark. It shows yahoo's webserver offering my browser (which was actually the Burp proxy) a reasonable choice of three strong cipher suites. But Burp wasn't able to support any of them. I'm guessing this was due to the US government's well-known restrictions on exporting cryptographic technology.

Cipher Suite: TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (0xc02f)

Cipher Suite: TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (0x009c)

Cipher Suite: TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (0xc030)
I easily solved the problem by downloading Oracle's Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files 8, as suggested on these two pages:

http://cybergibbons.com/security-2/burp-suite/missing-tls-ciphers-when-running-burp-suite/

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37741142/how-to-install-unlimited-strength-jce-for-java-8-in-os-x

After installing the JCE and restarting Burp, the problem was gone.
